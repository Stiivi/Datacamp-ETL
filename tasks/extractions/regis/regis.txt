***RegisdownloadLoading

Regisdownload script downloads files from http://www.statistics.sk/pls/wregis/dotaz

All entries (html files) are downloaded via wget - ID in URL is incremented on the selected interval. Currently the ID interval is from 1 to  cca 1 050 000 
(the URL template is http://www.statistics.sk/pls/wregis/detail?wxidorg=ID). 

Each entry is stored as ID.html

Note that some IDs are missing on the interval (very few) - in this case an empty html is created (wrapper script deals with them later).

ID of the last entry is obtained via observing the number of consecutive http 404 errors - if there are more then 10 consecutive 404errors (i.e. there are 10 continuous empty entries), we can presume that end of the database is reached (e.g., on 27th August 2009 ID of the last entry was 1044900).

The original Regis database is updated in following way:
- new entries (newly registered companies/people) are appended at the end - so that ID of the last entry increases.
- if there is a change in existing entry in database (typically some attribute of person/company is modified, like activity type or date of dissolution), its ID remains untouched.

In order to capture only newly added companies/people, it is sufficient to download only newly added IDs - obtain the last (highest) ID of existing entry in db from 'sys_loading_defaults' table (loading_name: regiswrapper, default_key: highest_id)

In order to capture all changes in Regis, whole database must be downloaded from scratch.

*** RegiswrapperLoading

Parse content from downloaded html files.
Path to directory with downloaded html files must be set.
clean wrapped data is stored into sta_regis_main table.
attribute 'code' corresponds to entry ID in regis db.

*** Additional notes

Downloading time: regis db was captured in cca 10 hours when downloading in 10 threads paralelly. No limitations from server side were observed during the download process.
Note that when running the script on some cheaper web hosting server, there can be a limit set by provider on number of files in your filesystem (e.g. Hostmonster.com - max 50000 files)

Wrapping time: 10 hours
